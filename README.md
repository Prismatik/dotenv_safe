#dotenv_safe

Similar to this dotenv package:

https://github.com/joho/godotenv

This adds an assurance layer. It demands that particular environment variables be set and panics if they aren't.

It uses the same paradigm as this node package:

https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv-safe

Which is that required env variables are contained in an example.env file in the project's root.
